# A sentiment analysis system with Na√Øve Bayes

A simple Java RMI application that involves both the client and server side of a distributed application: a simple sorting server.

The sorting server operates a stack and clients push values and operations on to the stack and each client will have its own stack. Operations are always sensible: that is, we will only push an operator after pushing at least on value and we will only pop when there is a value on the stack.
